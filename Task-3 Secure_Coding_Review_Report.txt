Code Review Summary:

- Code Quality: Resolved all formatting issues using autopep8(autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive C:\Code_Alpha\Calci.py)
 (e.g., line lengths, blank lines) as indicated by Flake8.
- Security Vulnerabilities: No critical security vulnerabilities were identified by Bandit.

Recommendations for Secure Coding Practices:
1. Use Secure Random Functions: Where randomness is required, use `secrets` module instead of `random` for cryptographically secure random numbers.
2. Regular Code Review: Continue using static analysis tools (like Flake8 and Bandit) periodically to catch issues early.
3. Input Validation: Ensure any user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
4. Error Handling: Use structured error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information.

Conclusion: The code appears secure based on the current analysis, with no major vulnerabilities detected.
